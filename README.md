# MyHomeApp
Smart home controller similar to the Google Home. Running on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

This might be one of those temporary, spur of the moment things, but I want to build a google home hub. I want to build it using a Raspberry Pi and maybe use my arduino as a microcontroller in some fashion.

I have already whishlisted most of the stuff I would need to at least get started on it but first let me write out some ideas I had for it.

* Will run an ASP.NET web server
* Pull info from multiple sources such as spotify, twitch, youtube, weather, and maybe more.
* Have a robust API for creating new applications for the device.
* Provide real time data.
* Be controlled through a web interface.
* Everything needs to be contained within a box
